A signed number - x equals an unsigned number 2^n - x
ex: x = -43 in signed and x = 2^32 - 43 in unsigned

In signed representation the next number after 2^(n-1) - 1  is -2^(n-1) .
In unsigned next number of 2(n) - 1 is 0 
ex : x = 2^(31) - 1 next number in signed is -2^(31)

HACKS : Using the bitwise and operator we can check if a number is even beacuse 
        x & 1 = 0 if x is even and x&1 = 1 if x is odd
        ( x is divisible by 2^k exactly when ( x & 2^k - 1 = 0 ) )  



The left bit shifts x << k appends k zero bits to the number 
The right bit shifts removes the k last bits from the number

x << k corresponds to multiplying x by 2^k 
x >> k corresponds to dividing x by 2^k rounded to an integer .
